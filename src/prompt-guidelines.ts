    `Use baoer_signal_grep for content search. Start with pattern and optional path; omit mode and limit to let auto choose a complete small result or a broad summary. Use literal=true for literal code fragments rather than escaping them as regex.`,
    `An omitted path searches the project cwd. If an explicit subpath has zero matches, ordinary and content-analysis searches retry from cwd and return project-wide matches with an expansion notice. Explicit absolute paths and .. traversal can search outside cwd, except protected external system areas and .git internals. Git changes mode remains cwd-scoped.`,
    `For external source navigation, imports/tests/impact use the containing Git repository when detected, otherwise the target file's directory.`,
    `Use sufficient exact-match evidence directly; do not inspect or reread it only to obtain a citation, since returned matches already have path/line numbers. When definitions repeat, follow the relevant imports/callers before choosing the authoritative file.`,
    `Use the file samples in baoer_signal_grep summaries to choose evidence. Reuse the visible cursor with path or paths for matching lines; mode=summary pages the remaining files. Match counts are not relevance scores.`,
    `When source context is missing, use one baoer_signal_grep batch before reading whole files: {mode:"inspect",cursor:"<returned cursor>",matchIndices:[1,2]} or {mode:"inspect",targets:[{path:"src/example.ts",line:42}]}, at most ${String(MAX_INSPECT_TARGETS)} locations. Copy actual returned selectors. Inspection chooses its own bounded window: omit pattern, context, limit, glob, exclude, literal, ignoreCase and hidden.`,
    `Use allOf:["term1","term2"] for explicit same-file literal AND, or add within:"function" for own-implementation JS/TS/TSX code. Use roles:["declaration"] or roles:["call"] with a single pattern for JS/TS/TSX/Go syntactic occurrences.`,
    `Use anyOf:["term1","term2"] when every exact occurrence of 2-64 literals is needed in one version-bound result. It is case-sensitive, reports retained counts per input term, and runs requests above eight terms as bounded parallel chunks.`,
    `For a changed-code question, add changes:{base:"HEAD",scope:"lines",side:"new"}; omit target for the working tree, use side:"old" for deleted evidence. Copy returned continuation requests to preserve source versions.`,
    `Use mode:"outline" with path to see symbols, mode:"imports" with path and a binding symbol or line to follow static named/default ESM links, and mode:"tests" with path for related test candidates. Import links do not prove runtime calls; test candidates do not prove coverage or passing tests.`,
    `Before changing one known JS/TS/TSX symbol, use mode:"impact" with path plus symbol or line to retrieve the exact target, every exact same-spelling candidate, and related-test evidence together. Same spelling does not prove binding, and returned tests have not been run.`,
    `If inspection reports missing source, execute its complete nextRequest with sourceCursor. Never treat a partial source excerpt as the complete implementation.`,
    `When status=partial, read details.analysis.coverage to see which conclusion is incomplete; an exact occurrence count may remain complete even when syntax or related-test analysis is partial.`,
